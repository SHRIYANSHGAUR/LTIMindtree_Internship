## Data Drift Detection using DEEPCHECKS
### "Drift" is a term used in machine learning to describe how the performance of a machine learning model in production slowly gets worse over time. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as changes in the distribution of the input data over time or the relationship between the input (x) and the desired target (y) changing. 
Drift can be a big problem when we use machine learning in the real world, where data is often dynamic and always changing. 
## Algorithms to measure 
### Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is a nonparametric statistical test that is used to determine whether two sets of data come from the same distribution. It is often used to test whether a sample of data comes from a specific population or to compare two samples to determine if they come from the same population.
The null hypothesis in this test is that the distributions are the same. If this hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that there is a drift in the model.
The K-S test is a useful tool for comparing datasets and determining whether they come from the same distribution.
